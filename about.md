Hej!

I'm a self-taught software engineer with 10+ years of experience.
I've worked with Go, Python, Ruby, Objective-C, TypeScript and PHP. But Go and Python are favourites.

This is a safe space where I write about tech, career, time management, and whatever else I feel like.

The name I use for this blog (murder bot) is based on the sci-fi book series "Murder bot diaries", which I really like.

See you around!
