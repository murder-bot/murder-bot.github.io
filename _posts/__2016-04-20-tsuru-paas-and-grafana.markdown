I wanted to try grafana out inside a project and so I wonder, why not Tsuru?

I'm core developer and co-author of Tsuru and it's been a while since last I contributed to it, so I need
some refreshing. Grafana is an awesome tool that I want to try out, so it's a perfect match. This is
helpful to anyone building a cloud and want to see Tsuru's internals through Grafana.
